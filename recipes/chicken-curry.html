    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indian chicken curry can vary from region to region, even the most basic recipes.
      What they do have in common, though, is a sauce made with onions, garlic, tomato,
      and the authentic spices of India such as coriander, turmeric, and garam masala.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, sliced thin</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coriander powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep skillet over medium heat and fry the onions until golden brown.
              Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Turn off heat,
              keeping oil in the pan. </li>
            <li>Grind the onions into a smooth paste in a food processor.
              Remove to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the food processor, grind the tomatoes, garlic paste,
              and ginger paste together into a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in the skillet again and add the onion paste. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes.
              Add the tomato paste and all the spicesâ€”coriander, cumin, turmeric,
              and red chili and garam masala powders. Mix well. (This is called masala.) </li>
            <li>Fry the masala until the oil begins to separate from it.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the masala and brown well, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped coriander and serve with hot chapatis (Indian flatbread),
              naans (tandoor-baked Indian flatbread), or basmati rice. </li>
        </ol>

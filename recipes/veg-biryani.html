      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, rinse 1.5 cups of basmati rice (300 grams) in clean water
              until the water runs clear of starch. You can use a bowl or colander
              to rinse the rice. Make sure you soak the rice grains in water for
              30 minutes after rinsing them.</li>
            <li>Once the rice has been able to soak for 30 minutes, drain all the water and set aside. </li>
            <li>While the basmati rice is soaking, use that time to prep the other ingredients.
              First, you will want to rinse, peel and chop all of the veggies.
              This will make the process of cooking go by much quicker.</li>
            <li>After you have organized and chopped all of your vegetables, it is time to
              cook the basmati rice. You can use any method to cook your rice – microwave,
              pressure cooking, instant pot or cooking in a pot.</li>
            <li>
              When the water is hot, add all the spices and 1 teaspoon salt.
              Here’s what you want to include for your veg dum biryani in this step:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tej patta</li>
                    <li>3 green cardamoms</li>
                    <li>3 cloves</li>
                    <li>1 black cardamom</li>
                    <li>1 inch true cinnamon or 1 inch cassia cinnamon</li>

                </ul>
